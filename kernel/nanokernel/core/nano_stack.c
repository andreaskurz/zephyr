DESCRIPTION
This module provides the VxMicro nanokernel (aka system-level) 'stack'
implementation.  This module provides the backing implementation for the
following APIs:

   nano_stack_init
   nano_fiber_stack_push, nano_task_stack_push, nano_isr_stack_push
   nano_fiber_stack_pop, nano_task_stack_pop, nano_isr_stack_pop
   nano_fiber_stack_pop_wait, nano_task_stack_pop_wait


INTERNAL
In some cases the compiler "alias" attribute is used to map two or more
APIs to the same function, since they have identical implementations.

Reference entries for these APIs may eventually be created in the directory
target/src/kernel/arch/doc.
